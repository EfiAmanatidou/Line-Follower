# Line-Follower
Me and my co-worker made this project for our embedded system class.
We used ArduinoUNO, 2 gear motors, a 9 Volt battery, a 3-way road tracking module, a L293D chip, breadboard, some cables, a power button, 2 speed encoder 4 Fasteners and a universal wheel.
The chassis dimensions are 20x14 cm.
